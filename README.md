Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017).

(A) (Far left) choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with neovascular membrane (white arrowheads) and associated subretinal fluid (arrows). (Middle left) Diabetic macular edema (DME) with retinal-thickening-associated intraretinal fluid (arrows). (Middle right) Multiple drusen (arrowheads) present in early AMD. (Far right) Normal retina with preserved foveal contour and absence of any retinal fluid/edema.

**Content**

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN). There are 84,495 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 4 categories (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN).

Images are labeled as (disease)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number by this patient) and split into 4 directories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images (Spectralis OCT, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) were selected from retrospective cohorts of adult patients from the Shiley Eye Institute of the University of California San Diego, the California Retinal Research Foundation, Medical Center Ophthalmology Associates, the Shanghai First People’s Hospital, and Beijing Tongren Eye Center between July 1, 2013 and March 1, 2017.

Before training, each image went through a tiered grading system consisting of multiple layers of trained graders of increasing exper- tise for verification and correction of image labels. Each image imported into the database started with a label matching the most recent diagnosis of the patient. The first tier of graders consisted of undergraduate and medical students who had taken and passed an OCT interpretation course review. This first tier of graders conducted initial quality control and excluded OCT images containing severe artifacts or significant image resolution reductions. The second tier of graders consisted of four ophthalmologists who independently graded each image that had passed the first tier. The presence or absence of choroidal neovascularization (active or in the form of subretinal fibrosis), macular edema, drusen, and other pathologies visible on the OCT scan were recorded. Finally, a third tier of two senior independent retinal specialists, each with over 20 years of clinical retina experience, verified the true labels for each image. The dataset selection and stratification process is displayed in a CONSORT-style diagram in Figure 2B. To account for human error in grading, a validation subset of 993 scans was graded separately by two ophthalmologist graders, with disagreement in clinical labels arbitrated by a senior retinal specialist.
